        <p>My main focus is photography so design for me a little bit harder.
        I started getting into photography back in 2014 when I had an iPhone 4
      in high school just going around and taking sunset photos. On christmas of
    2015 my parents gifted me my first camera, a Nikon D3300. I would take photos
  of my friends and sporting events at my school. The photos were awful. But for
whatever reason I just loved taking photos. After being at JCTC I've learned so much.
I'm now taking photos I never even dreamed by back just 5 years ago.
Like I hinted before design has taken a back seat to my photography but I understand
it's just as important as taking photos. I mean even taking photos is a form of
design. I'm pretty decent in photoshop and I'm always looking for new ways to take
and edit photos. For example I've learned how to do a "3D" effect where I just take
multiple photos while walking around them, or making a video/gif of a sequence of
photos.
After I'm done with JCTC I hope to get a job in sport photography. Whether that be
with a collge or university or a professional teams. Or preferrably both. I pretty
much want to be shooting sports all year around. And if I'm not doing that this I
can do portraits or commerical if needed. But that's the plan for now.
